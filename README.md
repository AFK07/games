## Pong Game

Currently a simple version of a pong game for 2 players. Further logic implementation of an artificial opponent is to be added soon.

# How to play

Player A (button controls are W for up and S for down) on the left side and Player B (the up arrow key and down arrow key) on the left side with the Esc button to pause and unpause.

# Rules

The ball starts from the centre to either player. If any of the players fail to return a serve, the opposing player gets a point.

# Scoring

The scores are updated on the top centre.

# Further updates

OOP program for cleanliness.
A main menu which will contain buttons for start, option, and exit. Pressing start shall provide the option of setting difficulties where higher difficulty sets for a faster ball speed. 
The paddles at the moment have a fixed speed: this is to balance the difficulty as a cursor-controlled paddle would prevent the usage of player 2. Therefore, the speed of the ball determines the game's difficulty.
The option for win/loss ratio may be added as a scoreboard.
